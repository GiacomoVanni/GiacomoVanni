Passionate and motivated software developer based in Milan with 2 years of professional experience developing with C# and Unity.

Interested in all kinds of technologies, in particular everything regarding Shaders, Videogames, AR/VR/XR, and AI.

I think the best part of our job is to find a new problem to solve and nothing gratifies me more than doing it.

I've spent five years working in the family business to pay for my studies, which's lead me to understand even more how much I love coding and in particular solving problems.
