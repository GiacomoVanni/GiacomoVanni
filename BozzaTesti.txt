sottotitolo: Ã¨ un Atlante interattivo di neuroanatomia.



HeadAtlas is the second project I've worked on as a Software developer for UpSurgeOn.
It took us 6 months from the start to the publishing on both GooglePlay and AppStore.
It was a very strong but inspiring challenge for me, as the only Developer, to build this app.
It helped me enhance my teamwork and understanding

Selection Without Colliders


Due to optimization needs (We had more than 3 Milions vertices), we decided to remove all colliders from our 3D objects in the scenes.
This solution leads to a major performance improvement but it creates another problem: Raycast to select an object is now unavaible.

To solve this problem I used a render texture applied on a Plane that mirrors the rendered screen but, instead of using the normal object material, 
I used a UNIQUE randomly generated RGB color code applied to every single interactable's object shader. (See video)
After that, we can easly check, given the user's input position, the same position on the renderPlane and get the precise color of the selected pixel.
Given the fact that every color is Object-unique, we can easly return the selected object without using any raycasts or colliders.
  



A full 3D and Augmented Reality app for studying neuroanatomical details on mobile devices.
You can access more than 2500 labels and descriptions and use 3 different visualization tools: create sections, isolate objects, exploded view.

Head Atlas also contains new modules like ARTouch (physical part purchasable on UpSurgeOn store) where you can observe neuroanatomy in a hybrid way.
Head Atlas provides a variety of texts organised into three cognitive levels, from general overviews to highly specific definitions, to facilitate learning and memorisation.

FEATURES
* 3D and Augmented Reality neuroanatomy
* Every single structure (Skull bones, Vascular and nervous system) can be reached and interacted with.
* You can rotate models to any angles and zoom in and out
* Hide structures to reveal the anatomy below.
* Anatomical details organised into groups of labels and hotspots.
* 2500+ labels and descriptions of details and sutures
* Different neuroanatomical visualisation tools: section, explode, color and texture
* New modules coming soon
