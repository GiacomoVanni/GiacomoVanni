sottotitolo: Ã¨ un Atlante interattivo di neuroanatomia.



HeadAtlas is the second project I've worked on as a Software developer for UpSurgeOn.
It took us 6 months from the start to the publishing on both GooglePlay and AppStore.
It was a very strong but inspiring challenge for me, as the only Developer, to build this app.
It helped me enhance my teamwork and understanding

Selection Without Colliders


Due to optimization needs (We had more than 3 Milions vertices), we decided to remove all colliders from our 3D objects in the scenes.
This solution leads to a major performance improvement but it creates another problem: Raycast to select an object is now unavaible.

To solve this problem I used a render texture applied on a Plane that mirrors the rendered screen but, instead of using the normal object material, 
I used a UNIQUE randomly generated RGB color code applied to every single interactable's object shader. (See video)
After that, we can easly check, given the user's input position, the same position on the renderPlane and get the precise color of the selected pixel.
Given the fact that every color is Object-unique, we can easly return the selected object without using any raycasts or colliders.
